# Southampton PhD Thesis LaTeX Template

## General
This thesis template follows the University of Southampton guidelines as described in May 2018 on the University web sites [here](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/quality/pgr/research_degree_candidature/completion.page) and [here](https://library.soton.ac.uk/thesis/templates).

This template was inspired by other templates by the following people:
* [Steve Gunn](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-southampton-thesis-template/wdnqpnjwspqp)
* [William Woodhead](https://github.com/lux01/soton-thesis)
* [Alexandra Diem](https://github.com/akdiem/phd_thesis_template)

To use the template clone the repository and edit the corresponding `*.tex` files. Alternatively the class file `sotonphd.cls` can be copied into the appropriate `texmf/tex/latex/` local folder. On a Mac with TeX Live installed the class file can be saved as follows: `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/sotonphd/sotonphd.cls`.
